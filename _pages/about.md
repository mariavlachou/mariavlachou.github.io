I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Language and Multimodal Processing Group](https://lampgroup.github.io), University of Copenhagen, working with [Desmond Elliott](https://elliottd.github.io). Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Glasgow [Terrier Team](https://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk). During my PhD, my research was centered around the evaluation of Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) and Information Retrieval systems. In particular, my work includes failure prediction in CRS, CRS evaluation under different scenarios, data annotation and enriching user simulator behaviour in CRS, and query performance prediction for dense retrieval. I was supervised by [Craig Macdonald](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/craigmacdonald/) and [Alessandro Vinciarelli](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/alessandrovinciarelli/). 

My PhD was funded by the [Social AI CDT](https://socialcdt.org), which has allowed me to be part of a multidisciplinary research environment. Apart from that, I consider myself an interdisciplinary person, as prior to my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Data Analytics, a Research Master in (Quantitative) Psychology, and a BSc in Psychology. Before returning to my research path, I worked as a BI Developer for the Pharmaceutical Industry. Outside of work, I enjoy ballet, theatre, and yoga.
